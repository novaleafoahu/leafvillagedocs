## What's up 🍃 

Hello there... I created this site to journal my gardening progress and publish notes that may be useful to others starting a gardening journey. During years of experimenting with growing vegetables and plants, I realized finding information was a challenge. I decided to create this site to hopefully make things easier to understand. If you have any questions, drop me a message or hit me up on one of my social media accounts. I would be happy to help.  Follow me on 🎬Tiktok and 📸IG.
