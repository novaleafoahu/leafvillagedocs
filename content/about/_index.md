## Hello there and thank you for visiting my site! 🍃 

I created this site to journal my gardening progress and publish notes that may be useful to others starting their own gardening journey. During years of experimenting with growing vegetables and plants, I realized finding information was a challenge. I decided to create this site to not only track my progress, but to also help others. 

If you have any questions, drop me a message or hit me up on one of my social media accounts. I would be happy to help.  Follow me on 🎬Tiktok and 📸IG.
